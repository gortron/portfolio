## The Troubles

I’m curious to learn the histories of each port I pass through. It’s a compulsive need to know where I am in the story, which chapter it is. I’ll read what was here before me and imagine the events to come. The chapter of Bali I felt most needed to be read is one I first heard from one of you in conversation. The chapter is called ‘The Troubles,’ and I’ll relate it to you here briefly.

In 1965, six Generals of the Indonesian Army were assassinated in a failed coup d’état. The army controlled the narrative of the events of what would come after, a narrative which would not be questioned and challenged until many years later. Along with the president, the army quickly placed the blame superficially on the communist party. While the party had the support of several million farmers and craftsmen, it was not trusted by other political groups and religious leaders. Anti-communist violence spread across the principal island of Java, and eventually to Bali and other Indonesian islands. The army combed through the country, killing known and suspected communists. They were aided by Americans stationed in Indonesia who provided a list of target names to the Indonesian Army. Many rural areas of Indonesia took the anti-communist purge into their own hands, butchering their neighbors through the humid nights. There is no number for the dead; estimates range, and 500,000 is an often quoted figure. In both brutality and scope, it was one of the worst massacres of the 21st century. It is also one of the least talked about.

It’s a difficult chapter, though it doesn’t make Bali less than it is. No, the island and its culture are more beautiful for its having happened. The wonder of the elaborate and sprawling rice terraces, and in the uncoordinated cicadidae and simian choirs of the jungle, and of floating in the warm salt bath of the Indian Ocean as the monsoon rains fall; that wonder is stirred as paint on a palette with the shame in the depth of human fear and savagery, and the resulting color is dark and deep. It’s a shade which reminds us that most things reveal themselves to be more resilient than we once thought.

## From the Editor

**Where I am:** Bali, Indonesia

**Where I’m going:** Colombo, Sri Lanka (Please let me know if you have been and have travel recommendations. I’ve a week with nothing planned.)

**What I’m chewing on:** What is something you’ve surrendered? Tell me about a battle you’ve lost; an attitude, struggle, possession, or belief which you have relinquished in time.

Not a day goes by that I’m not missing you and thinking of you in some way. Take good care of each other, my loves. –G

## On Light and Storms

I continue to be impressed with the diversity and volume of your responses, and I thank you for writing in. Kerouac, Camus, and Epictetus were represented; there were articles, poems, and passages. Writings shared were insightful to what matters to each of you, and why. But, life is pressing. Let’s move quickly. Two of you volunteered the following passage, which I also have kept a copy of in the file cabinets in the offices of my heart.

> “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn’t serve the world. There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.” _Marianne Williamson_

Consider this analogy to the passage: we have no choice in the present to be anywhere but where we are. We have the agency to change future moments, but not the present one. Each present moment is a scene, a feeling, beyond our control. Yet, how far do we strive to put obstacles between ourselves and the present? We are always posturing and planning to change it into something it isn’t, even though we know any change won’t unfold until some other moment, minutes or years further on. We do this because the present moment overpowers us; presence is a sensation so glorious that it is unbearable. Maybe you’ve held real presence for a kiss or a particularly beautiful view, but who can say they’ve held it longer than they haven’t? We’ll do anything to avoid or anesthetize the true experience of the present. So, it is the present, not the future, that most frightens us. I want to advise you to rip open the iris which keeps the light out, which keeps the present out, and that doing so is an imperative for the human spirit, but I can’t. I fail at this more often than I succeed, of course. If there exists a secret to presence, it’s hidden to me.

Maybe, if there were a trick to deep presence, that trick would be called surrender. Maybe, grasping at the hope of “more" in future moments is a thin screen between us and painful, ecstatic presence. Maybe, Haruki Murakami articulates surrender well.

> “Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn’t something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn’t get in, and walk through it, step by step. There’s no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That’s the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.
>
> And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You’ll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.
>
> And once the storm is over you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.” _Haruki Murakami_
