_dispatch from 01°18'17", 103°51'33"_

Good afternoon lovelies, and thank you for bearing with some technical difficulties.

I’d like to open the fifth volume of drift with a passage from _East of Eden_:

> “Sometimes a kind of glory lights up the mind of a man. It happens to nearly everyone. You can feel it growing or preparing like a fuse burning toward dynamite. It is a feeling in the stomach, a delight of the nerves, of the forearms. The skin tastes the air, and every deep-drawn breath is sweet. Its beginning has the pleasure of a great stretching yawn; it flashes in the brain and the whole world glows outside your eyes. A man may have lived all of his life in the gray, and the land and trees of him dark and somber. The events, even the important ones, may have trooped by faceless and pale. And then -the glory- so that a cricket song sweetens his ears, the smell of the earth rises chanting to his nose, and dappling light under a tree blesses his eyes. Then a man pours outward, a torrent of him, and yet he is not diminished. And I guess a man’s importance in the world can be measured by the quality and number of his glories. It is a lonely thing but it relates us to the world. It is the mother of all creativeness, and it sets each man separate from all other men.”


Sharing this with you isn’t to say I’m in a ‘glory’. I got my ass kicked by the suffocating, magnificent humanity of Hong Kong. I couldn’t write. I barely slept. I got stood up. I felt an unfair malice towards many, and I wasn’t sorry for any of it. Not every day will be defined by a sense of wonder and adventure. I will not always succeed on the road, if we choose to define a successful trip that way (I don’t). I carry no false expectations. I would not be wandering beyond my horizon if traveling were a series of easy moments. I won’t offer a perfect journey (I can’t), but I can promise that I will present my self authentically to you for the duration. I’m not seeking certainties and I’m not trying to put the world in my pocket. It’s the doubt, that _mystery_, which I’m after.

Responses to _what brings out your best_ were as diverse as the audience. If there were emergent themes on tactics to bring out our best, they were lost on me. So, I will speak for myself, and allow the readers to speak for themselves.

Uncertainty brings out my best. Parties where I don’t know a soul; not knowing if someone will continue to love me as my flaws begin to precipitate; first time with an untested recipe; being unsure of how a client will react, so preparing for all scenarios; first day in an unfamiliar city; the first kiss. What is so effective about uncertainty in bringing out my best is that it kills my ego. I am not afraid to be the beginner. Whether by capturing my curiosity or by distracting me from insecurity, that incessant internal voice is silenced which just leaves… me. All of me, broadcasting at a FM frequency of relaxed confidence.

From the drifters:

- “Empathy. I try to make everyone’s voices feel important and feel heard and feel affecting. I try equally hard to make people feel crucial to a project or just to a night out. The more crucial people feel the better they perform both professionally and personally, and I love when I can help with that.“
- "Don’t try to ensure success, remove the shame from failure. That’s everything.”
- “To bring out the best in others, I always approach every interaction with everyone I meet, no matter what, like they are a person I’ve known and loved for a long long time. It’s an approach inspired by my grandfather, who taught me to treat everyone like an old friend. It happens to also make you a very memorable person, but more importantly is what it does in the moment: makes people feel valued and worthy or your attention.”
- “I also think providing a bit of push back brings out the best in others. I think a lot of women and men say what they think wants to be heard, but that just fosters a really destructive mediocrity.”

**Where I am:** Singapore

**Where I’m going:** Bali, Indonesia

**What I’m chewing on:** Please share one of your favorite pieces of writing. It can be a pithy quote, prose that stuck with you, an article which changed your opinion—the choice is yours, friend—but please send me something which moves you. Something you keep close to your heart. (you can [read mine here](http://timshel.org/timshel.php)—doubling down on Steinbeck today because I miss the hills of California)

Thinking of you. –G

## The Thin Slice:

- Met up with one of you! Drew and I will be traveling through Indonesia this week.
- Finished three books (Guns, Germs, and Steel by Neil Diamond, Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Men Explain Things to Me by Rebecca Solnit—liberal drifters, eat your hearts out).
- Ate 40+ dumplings (more like xiao long WOW)
- Made friends from six different countries.
- Was myself in three different countries.
- Got wildly lost looking for two things: an abandoned fishing village in Hong Kong’s Outer Territories, and some peace of mind. Hoofed 17 miles, and only found one of the two.
- Had a beer in a bar from a colonial-era bar which has endured through Singapore’s aggressive modernization in the second half of the 20th century.
- Listened to a brass band cover I Want You Back in 75% humidity.
- Witnessed a Filipino man karaoke My Way, a little drunk and demonstrably nostalgic. It was explained to me by other patrons that this song, sung in such a manner, is something of a national _pinoy_ tradition.
