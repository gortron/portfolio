“If your invention works, it will surpass all of my designs.” The old man let the parchment papers roll up in his lap and stared out the window into April, still cold. “I will be nearly forgotten by history. They will remember me only as the talented father of a boy who changed the world.”

“But your invention will never work.” He turned, smiling, and began to cough, almost dropping the designs as he handed them back. Raphael, son of the great Leonardo da Vinci, frowned. He took the rolled papers and kissed his father’s hand before leaving the room.

\*\*\*

Suleiman the Magnificent stared West from the eastern embankment of the Bosporus, across the straight, unable to make sense of what he saw.

A mountain of golden metal. It reached as close to the Heavens as the _Hagia Sophia_, was as wide as the _Mese_. Its rhythmic scrunching movements reminded him of a caterpillar he had seen in his gardens. It sounded like an earthquake as it crawled in the distance.

_This_, Suleiman thought, _was going to be a difficult day_.

The infernal machine began slowly to cross the straight. But it was not touching the water. As it moved, a shimmering bridge formed in front of it, stretching across the vast Bosporus.

Suleiman the Magnificent surveyed the divisions of his army, arrayed on the embankment. Time seemed to stretch while he waited for the machine, moving at the space of a walk, to draw close enough for his janissaries to attack.

In the late afternoon, after many hours, the bridge of the machine finally extended to the eastern bank, and the machine came within range of the Ottoman Army.

\*\*\*

Suleiman the Magnificent gestured to his generals, who yelled for their men to loose their guns and crossbows at the machine. But, as the missiles approached its glimmering shell, they exploded into fireworks. Behind the fantastic display of fireworks, the machine began to shake, and the sides of its massive carapace began to unfold slowly over the water.

People began to stream out onto the platforms now extended over the water. But, to Suleiman the Magnificent, they did not look like soldiers. They looked, rather, like _revelers_. Revelers in fine gowns and robes, who had come out to watch the fireworks and were clapping and cheering at the wild explosions.

Suleiman frowned. _This_, he realized, _was going to be a_ very _difficult day_.

\*\*\*

Suleiman the Magnificent turned to his mightiest warrior and personal guard, the Lion.

“You are peerless; my mightiest janissary. You are brave, and swift, and strong. You have served me faithfully, always, and the men respect you like a warrior king. Have you ever been defeated in combat?”

“No,” the Lion replied, staring past Suleiman at the shining monolith.

“Are you willing to die today, and go to Heaven, if that is God’s will?”

“Yes.”

“Enter that machine of war, and defend your king, your city, and your countrymen by destroying it.”

The Lion put on his helmet, and began charging towards the machine. He ran through Suleiman’s ranks and the men cheered as he passed them. He ran across the beach and began running up the shimmering bridge that the infernal machine now rested upon. He ran up the bridge, and as he got closer to the machine, he became more difficult to see. Like a mirage, the vision of his body began to wave like a shadow, until finally it disappeared into the backdrop of the machine.

\*\*\*

An hour passed, and the Lion did not return.

Suleiman the Magnificent turned to his wealthiest merchant and minister, the Duke.

“You are the wealthiest merchant in the empire. You are shrewd, cunning, and gracious. At the docks, the workers and counters listen to your word as the word of _Allah_, and they respect you like a merchant king. Have you ever failed a negotiation?”

“No,” the Duke replied.

“Are you willing to negotiate with this invader?”

“Yes.”

“Enter that foreign machine, and coerce its pilots with the wealth of our empire.”

The Duke wrapped his purple silk cape around him, and strode towards the machine.

\*\*\*

Another hour passed, and the Duke did not return.

Suleiman the Magnificent turned to his wisest philosopher and vizier, the Sage.

“You are the wisest philosopher of this age. You are curious, learned, and patient. You can see God’s truth even in the darkest room. At the university, the students crowd to listen to you speak, and they respect you like a philosopher king. Have you ever failed to teach a student?”

“No,” the Sage replied.

“Are you willing to learn some of God’s most articulate secrets today, if that is God’s will?”

“Yes.”

“Enter that strange machine, and teach it the folly of attacking our empire.”

The Sage adjusted his large head wrap, and walked slowly to the machine.

\*\*\*

Another hour passed, and the Sage did not return.

Suleiman the Magnificent despaired. His mightiest warrior, his wealthiest merchant, and his wisest philosopher had all failed to stop the infernal machine and the demonic revelers inside. It continued to crawl slowly on the shimmering bridge in front of it, which now spanned the entire river. _This infernal machine will destroy the Ottomans, Istanbul; everything I have built. We will be forgotten by history,_ he thought.

Suleiman’s niece, Fatimah, a young artist, approached her despairing Uncle.

“Uncle,” Fatimah said to Suleiman. “Though I am young, I am the best artist in Istanbul. I doubt that I can stop the machine, but I can record what will happen, so history will remember the Ottomans, Istanbul, and all that you built.”

“Fatimah, my child, you are magnificent; our finest artist. When you paint, you show things as they are and as they could be. Your masterful brush strokes capture even a mote of dust in the scenes you paint. Your life is your own, my child. If you wish to die, like the Lion, the Duke, and the Sage, then I cannot stop you from painting the final moments of the Ottomans.”

“Thank you, Uncle. I have been gifted the ability to paint impressive likenesses. But all of my paintings fall short of perfection. They are all missing something, something essential that I can’t quite put my finger on.In the Ottomans’ final hour, in _my_ final hour, I will paint a perfect history for us, if it is God’s will.”

Fatimah bowed to her uncle, slung her painting materials over her shoulder, and walked down the embankment towards the machine.

\*\*\*

As she reached the river’s edge, she came to the wide glittering bridge. The bridge frightened Fatimah. It looked like candles reflected in her mother’s diamonds on the night of her uncle’s birthday. She squatted down to look closely at the bridge, so that she could paint it later from memory. She took her first step carefully, and almost could not believe that the it was solid beneath her foot. The bridge vibrated. She took another tentative step, then continued her way up towards the machine.

As she got closer to the infernal machine, her feelings of fear and awe mad her feel dizzy. She had seen wonders in the court of her uncle, but nothing like what towered above her now. If she were more superstitious or more pious, she thought, she might not be able to take another step towards it. The machine was massive, as tall and wide as the _Hagia Sophia_, with rounded sides like a metallic caterpillar. The air around it shimmered like the bridge beneath her, and it looked like the machine was surrounded by motes of dust capturing the sun’s light. It moved so slowly that she could not be certain it moved at all, except she suspected its movement caused the bridge to shake beneath her feet. _Whose army is this that travels in a metal mountain over a bridge of diamonds?_

As she neared the infernal machine, she could see that at the front of it were round and wide metallic steps leading up to tall wooden doors. Flanking the doors were a man and a woman, each dressed as revelers, in the Venetian style she had seen guests at her uncle’s celebrations wear. She ascended the stairs, and to her embarrassment her clothes changed on her body as she walked. By the time she reached the top, she looked like the woman standing beside the doorway to the machine.

“Welcome, my lady, to the _Machina_,” said the reveler to the right of the doors. “My name is Marcelo. I will be your escort and your guide here. If at any point you wish to leave, speak to me and I will bring you back here.”

“Are you taking me prisoner?” Fatimah asked.

“No, my lady. You are free to leave at any point. But if you leave, you will not be allowed to return.”

“What happened to my clothes?” Fatimah asked.

“The _Machina_ is a marvelous machine capable of many miracles. Our host will be able to explain more. Would you like me to take you to him?”

“Yes. Take me to the man that wishes to destroy Istanbul.”

\*\*\*

Marcelo leaned towards the tall wooden doors, and knocked twice with his fist. The door opened inwards and, though it was dusk outside of the _Machina_, a warm afternoon light poured out into the evening air.

"Please come in," Marcelo said gesturing to Fatimah to enter.

Fatimah stared uncertainly at the doors and then back to Marcelo, who was smiling politely at her. _If the outside of the machine has already produced such beautiful miracles, God, what will I find inside?_

She climbed the last few steps and entered the _Machina_.

\*\*\*

Fatimah had seen many wonderful things in her life; the brightest treasures from all corners of the Ottoman empire; oceans of grass rolling in the summer wind; the streets of Istanbul on the final night of Ramadan. _But nothing as wonderful as this_, she thought.

In front of her stretched a grand _piazza_, filled with thousands of people enjoying an afternoon that reminded her of the first day of Spring. The piazza was guarded on all sides by Italian-styled buildings that stretched as high as she imagined the Tower of Babel had. The dimensions of the _piazza_ were impossible, given the size of the machine she had seen from outside. _Another miracle; this machine is either the work of God, or a terribly clever djinn._

"Marcelo, who are these people?"

“Many people have come into the _Machina_ before you. Some have come to try and destroy it. Some have come to learn from it. Some have come to be closer to God. But none have ever left, though they are free to."

"Why did you stay?"

“The _Machina_ is a marvelous invention. I cannot explain it to you because I do not understand it. But I can tell you what I have seen with my eyes. People do not get sick here. People do not get old. People do not want for food. There are no wars. I have been here for a long time, I think, but what I can remember from my time before the _Machina_ was the _suffering_. I remember praying to God every night, *save us, o lord,*and still there was the suffering all around me. I do not feel that here."

Marcelo gestured to the center of the _piazza_, where Fatimah saw the tallest fountain that she had ever seen. The fountain was made of smooth white marble, and carved into it were many animals, always in pairs. Wet from the fountain's many spouts and tangled atop each other, the animals looked as though they were caught in a storm. At the bottom of fountain, the largest of the animals stood on top of a wide boat.

"Do you recognize the story of the Ark?" Marcelo asked.

Fatimah nodded.

"My lady, the _Machina_ is like the Ark. Everyone inside has been spared God's wrath by our host. So they stay here, safe from the harsh floodwaters of the world outside.”

"Is the host a prophet, then?” Fatimah asked.

"Maybe. Many who live here believe that to be true. He says he is simply a clever man that has learned how to build wonderful things."

"Will you take me to him?"

"Yes. We will need to cross the _piazza_. There is a feast every night in the great hall. Our host will be there."

\*\*\*

Fatimah followed Marcelo closely through the crowded piazza, which reminded her of the summer market in Istanbul. Rows of stalls filled the square, and from the stalls rose the smell of spiced meats, fresh bread, dried fruits, and wine. She saw merchants that looked to be from the world over; Jerusalem, Baghdad, Calcutta, Samarkand, Jicheng. They leaned over their stalls, smiling and offering Fatimah samples. She took a hesitant bite of some _kafta_, and her eyes widened in delight.

"Marcelo! I’ve eaten in my Uncle's palace, where delicacies from across the Ottoman empire are brought and prepared, but nothing tastes as good as what the merchants here are selling.”

"You aren't the first to say so. Inside the _Machina_, food tastes better, colors appear brighter, and every day carries Spring's warming light. But this will be difficult to understand: the merchants are not _selling_ the food, in fact they don't sell anything. Plants grow in such abundance in the fields beyond the _piazza_, and animals grow so quickly from grazing, that food could not fetch a price at all in the market. People don't sell goods or exchange them for others in the _Machina_. There is such abundance that the people are content, and grateful to serve each other in turn."

_It is as though all of God's love has been concentrated in this one miraculous machine. I haven't been faithful enough to be sent to Heaven. I must dreaming, then_. Fatimah continued to follow Marcelo deeper into the _Machina_.

\*\*\*

Fatimah recognized the Lion, her uncle's first champion, immediately. Though his military uniform had disappeared and he wore the same reveler's clothes that everyone in the _Machina_ wore, she knew him from his hulking frame of a body.

"Lion!" Fatimah yelled across the piazza to where he was sitting at a long table.

The Lion looked up from his food and wine at Fatimah, and to her surprise the typically stoic janissary smiled and waved her over.

"It is good to see you, my lady, an Ottoman kinsman in this city of miracles. Forgive me for asking, but what are you doing here?"

"I came to paint the history of the end of the Ottoman empire. Though we will not survive this invasion, a painting might. And you? My uncle had sent you to destroy the _Machina_ and the men inside. But you seem happy, not like you have killed foreign conquerors."

The Lion laughed. "No, my lady, what you say is true; I did not kill any foreign conquerors today, though I must have been a sight to our hosts, charging up the diamond-shimmer bridge, sword and shield raised, crying out for battle. Like you, it seems I changed as I ran up the stairs of the entrance to this miraculous machine. My sword and shield disappeared, my armor too, and were replaced with rich men's clothes. I was surprised, and afraid of the infernal magic, I continued charging at one of our hosts and raised a fist to beat him. It was like trying to hit someone in a dream. I moved so slowly that I would not have hit the door man until the Judgment day.

Eventually, exhausted, I surrendered. I begged them to give me a death fitting for a warrior. They ignored me, and graciously invited me in many times. In the shame of my surrender I followed them inside. And here we are! I don't know if I am alive or dead, if this is Heaven or hell. I don't know how long I've been here. It feels long ago that I was Suleiman's champion."

Fatimah nodded and asked, "It is strange to me that a veteran of many wars would give one up so quickly. Why did you forsake the Ottomans?"

The Lion smiled back at Fatimah, "I am _saving_ the Ottomans. I was dispirited and near madness when our hosts all but dragged me inside. As they explained what this place, is, I began to see things differently. I saw the happiness of the people around me, I tasted the abundance of excellent food and wine. No one sick, no one poor, no one suffering. Fatimah, as you say, I am a veteran of many wars. I have seen--and caused--much suffering. For what? For glory, for duty, for spoils? Your uncle waged war to take power from those with less. I was a warrior who thought him just and served him faithfully, but this place has washed me of all that.

“No city, no village, no outpost in the Ottoman empire or beyond is as blessed as this one. You could fight a thousand years, conquer every last kingdom, and still not be able to build a city like this one. And they will keep anyone who is willing to stay; they say it is big enough for the world! You must see I am not forsaking the Ottomans, Fatimah. I am _saving_ them. Do you see? God has not sent you to paint the death of the Ottomans. He has sent you to paint their salvation."

Fatimah saw that the warrior her uncle sent to take the _Machina_ had changed completely inside of it. She said, “I have lived all my life with a feeling that something was not put back in the right place the night before. My life’s great desire is to paint something _perfect_. But I have not seen anything perfect in my life, not here in this city or outside of it. You think it is perfect here, but it can’t be.

"We must be getting on. My steward says that our host is further in." She got up, and shouldered her bag of paints.

Fatimah gestured a farewell to the mighty warrior, and went with Marcelo further in to the piazza.

\*\*\*

“What troubles you, child?” Marcelo asked Fatimah, his expression comforting.

“It is true that there is some kind of magic at work to bless this place. It feels different here, like the way my skin feels on those summer nights when a thunderstorm passes over the palace in Istanbul. But I am afraid for you. I am afraid for the Lion. And I am afraid for myself. This place twists people’s minds and wrings out all sorrow, leaving only contentment.” _I am either dead or dreaming._

“Why are you afraid, then? Contentment is the measure of the good life, isn’t it? Before I came to this place, I was a priest. One day, we saw the _Machina_ moving in the distance. Many of the priests at my monastery saw the machine as a sign of the devil, a gate into hell from which the horsemen would ride. But nothing emerged from the machine as it crawled slowly past us in the distance. I laid awake that night, wondering what was inside the machine. I thought of the men of faith from the Old Testament, and about visions God laid before them to lure them closer to his holy kingdom.

“So I left the monastery, and entered the machine. I too was afraid, at first, that maybe the Devil had drawn me away from God like I could catch a fly with honey. But, I looked around me at the faces of the other guests, and do you know what they reminded me of? Men that had been converted, and now lived within the love of God.

I knew then that I was right to trust in God’s will, and that he had rewarded my faith by drawing me into his bosom.”

Fatimah thought for a moment, and asked Marcelo, “Do you think Heaven is… perfect?”

Marcelo nodded, “God’s will is perfect, and Heaven is his reward for the faithful.”

Fatimah was quiet then, and tried unsuccessfully to imagine Heaven and the perfection of God’s kingdom as she and Marcelo continued through the massive square inside the _Machina_.

\*\*\*

Fatimah had painted a portrait of the Duke, her uncle Suleiman’s second champion, and recognized his portly figure browsing in a section of market stalls. Though the silken threads and hat that marked his wealthy status had disappeared and been replaced with reveler's clothes, he retained his short, round body, his butcher block hands and thick hair.

“Hello, Duke,” Fatimah said as she approached the Duke at a stall of peaches.

The Duke glanced over to Fatimah, and to her surprise the shrewd merchant smiled genuinely at her. “Greetings, Fatimah. You have come to this place too? Has the machine taken all of Istanbul then?"

"No, I have come alone. After you and the Lion did not return, my uncle sent in the Sage. After he did not return, and our doom was certain, I came to paint the final hours of the Ottomans."

"I see," replied the Duke, "And what a painting it will be, though I don't suspect _doom_ is the word people will think of when they see your painting. How could you capture all the miracles of this machine on a canvas? Look at these peaches. Is there any paint you could mix on your palette that would capture their sunset hue? Having painted it, could you convince the viewer of the painting that such a peach existed? Or could be eaten for free from a stall, without punishment? That its flavor was so remarkable that you could give such a peach as the sole gift to a king, and that he would grant you a title and lands as thanks?"

_I’m certain now that the Machina changes the minds of men_, Fatimah thought, and felt a chill down her spine. "Duke, the Lion shared your fondness for this place. You were sent here to negotiate, and to convince these strange conquerors to spare Istanbul. Have you given up so easily?"

“Like you, I was guided from the entrance of the _Machina_ to meet with our host. I tried to bargain and negotiate with him to spare Istanbul, but how can you buy off a man with wealth like this?” the Duke gestured around the grand _piazza_. “Our host is a marvelous inventor, or else a magician. He showed me that my skills as a shrewd merchant mean little here. They have no want for supplies or money. Whatever is needed is grown or crafted gladly by the inhabitants, and there is such abundance that goods are shared freely with a smile with their neighbors.

“My instinct as a merchant is to sell people whatever they desire, at a profit to me. But I could never bring enough to the markets of Istanbul. There were many who could not afford to eat, and I could not afford to feed them. Here, there is enough for everyone. Yes, Fatimah, I gave up my negotiations so easily, and gladly. They were my final negotiations, and I can not say that I lost them.”

Fatimah tried to read the Duke’s expression, but the busiest trader of Istanbul now seemed at perfect ease. “Only days ago, you were the wealthiest man in the empire and one of the most powerful. Now, if I had not recognized you from my past, I would not have known who you are. You would throw away your wealth and status and remain here?”

“Fatimah, it feels much longer than days that I have been here. But what I remember from Istanbul is like a bad dream to me now. I could work a thousand years and never build a wealth like there is here. I woke up from that dream when I came through the doors into the _Machina_. This is the kingdom of Heaven, or else as close as I will get to it.”

“Good luck to you then, Duke. I must go further in to meet with our host.”

The Duke smiled and bowed to Fatimah, before turning back to browse and enjoy the stall of ripe peaches.

“Come, Fatimah,” Marcelo said, “we are not far from the great hall of our host now.”

\*\*\*

Marcelo and Fatimah were almost through the _piazza_, and before them a great hall rose above the wide flat expanse of the square. _It looks like my uncle’s palace_, thought Fatimah. *If the palace had been built by a prophet.*An impossibly large glass dome rested above the immense marble base of the building, which stretched high into the sky, so Fatimah had to crane her neck to see. At the corners of this building stood golden minarets glowing warmly in the late afternoon light, with staircases winding around them as far up as Fatimah could see. Long steps, alternating in alabaster and black marble, climbed up to a wide gilded doorway, which was open.

On the steps many revelers lounged, chatting in the sunny air. Fatimah recognized the Sage standing among them. He had tutored her and her cousins in astronomy and mathematics. Fatimah noticed his lanky arms, his arched back, his thick gray mustache, and his brown-green eyes widened by a pair of spectacles. The Sage was respected as one of the wisest scholars in the Ottoman Empire. He was not a stern teacher--wisdom has a way of humbling people--and so earned a place as Fatimah’s favorite. She waved to the Sage, who turned his head to look at her and smiled back. He gestured for her to come with his hand, and Fatimah quickly ascended the stairs to him.

“Hello, my child! Though this is a strange and blessed place, it is good to see you here.” The Sage said. He studied Fatimah with an amicable curiosity through his spectacles.

“It is good to see you, too. I have met with the Lion and the Duke, and I wondered when I was going to cross paths with you.”

“It seems so long ago that your uncle Suleiman asked me to follow them into this machine. Of course, I think I would have gone in anyway. You’ll remember that I’m a curious man, and there was never a box that I would not have risked death to open. What a box this machine turns out to be! And you, Fatimah, why have you come?”

“I was certain that this machine was going to destroy Istanbul, destroy _me_, and I wanted to fulfill my greatest dream in my final hours: to paint something _perfect_.”

“Ah, yes!” The Sage said, smiling at Fatimah, “Death brings out both our angels and our demons. But you won’t find death here. This place is magical, isn’t it? It is full of the vital essence that flows through all things. Can’t you feel it? It’s like a spring running over, filling the air with light and life.”

When Fatimah had studied with the Sage, he was a pragmatic man. His life moved to the predictable patterns of planets and equations, not the unseen mysteries.

_So then, his mind has changed here too._ _Will mine?_ “I know you, and I know you have come here to satiate your curiosity. What have you learned?”

The Sage was looking out across the _piazza_ from the steps, and turned to Fatimah to speak. “I think, Fatimah, here I have forgotten more than I’ve learned.”

He continued, “Before entering the _Machina_, I spent my entire life chasing knowledge. I thought, surely, that knowledge was better than ignorance. I studied for years at the _madrasa_ in Baghdad. I was the brightest student. My reputation grew as the most learned man in the empire.

All that knowledge, to what end?Yes, I trained brilliant pupils, like you, but for all that I had learned I was never happy. My pursuit of knowledge was like chasing a finch through the house of God. Every time I turned a corner I thought finally I would grab it, but there it would be flying through a new room I had never seen before. It dawned on me, walking through that _piazza_, that I was naive to think that knowledge for its own sake was a righteous pursuit. Knowledge is only noble if we put it to noble use. But my knowledge was never enough to comfort dying men, nor was it enough to feed the starving beggar children at the market.”

“But here?” The Sage laughed, “Here, I know less than I have ever known before, but look around you: is this not goodness? If you had asked me what the point of knowledge was, I would not have even been able to describe that _this_ is what the point was, to build a city like this. A city without fear or sin. A perfect city. You could study a thousand years and not learn enough to build a city like this.”

“I am glad that you have found joy here,” Fatimah said to the Sage. “But I have a keen eye. I can see behind things, and see them for what they really are. This city is miraculous, and yes it is full of goodness, but it isn’t perfect. It’s missing _something_, something essential, though I don’t know yet what it is.”

The Sage smiled down at Fatimah and with the tone of her _jida_ said, “Not knowing is the only place we can learn from!” He started walking away down the steps towards the _piazza_.

Over his shoulder he shouted, “You will find what you’ve come here looking for, I think! Take care, Fatimah.”

In spite of her gut feeling to mistrust this dream, Fatimah smiled and turned to Marcelo to continue up towards the great hall.

\*\*\*

The doors to the great hall were as wide as seven market stalls, golden and flung open. From inside came the sound of echoed laughter and music. Fatimah followed Marcelo into the hall, and for the second time that day she crossed a threshold which left her speechless and disoriented. The hall was massive. Fatimah looked up to see a cool white light shining through the glass dome roof. The roof was supported by many columns, covered in plants. The hall reminded her of the stories her mother used to tell her about Nebuchadnezzar and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Water trickled down the columns, reflecting the light from the dome and sparkling like dawn across the Bosporus. The plants looked alive with the movement of the water, which fell eventually into poolsthat lapped at the base of the columns. Peacocks called out from the columns, and glided between them. The air felt different in the hall. She felt like she had stepped into a forest glade that existed before anything else; before the Garden of Eden, before the Flood, before even _Allah_ had made the world.

On the floor of the immense hall, long wooden tables were woven between the columns.The tables were covered in food. The smell of spiced and roasted meats, bread, and mead wafted from the tables and made Fatimah’s mouth water. Many revelers sat on long benches at the tables, enjoying the feast.

At the end of one of the tables a handsome man with long hair and a short peppered beard sat alone. He was wearing, instead of the reveler’s clothes the rest of the guests wore, a dirty workshirt covered in paints and oils.

Fatimah asked Marcelo, “Is that…?”

“Yes, that is our host. Raphael da Vinci, son of the late Leonardo da Vinci. He built the _Machina_. I will introduce you to him, and then wait for you by the doors to the great hall. I’m sure you have many questions for him.”

Fatimah nodded, and tried to settle her stomach and racing heart. _What kind of a man could make something like this place?_

“Raphael,” Marcelo said, “may I introduce our fourth guest from Istanbul: Fatimah, niece of Suleiman the Magnificent, and celebrated painter.” Marcelo turned and left the two at the end of the long banquet table.

\*\*\*

Raphael looked up at Fatimah. His eyes were half-closed but their gaze was intense and full of light. Fatimah saw subtle signs of great emotion playing across his face. “Welcome to my _Machina_, Fatimah. Ah! I can see in your eyes that you are a painter, too. You don’t need to peer so hard into me. I will tell you anything you want to know. Come, let’s walk around the hall.” Raphael, stood from his chair, and gestured towards a carpeted path through the massive columns away from the din of the feast.

“You have traveled far to get here, Fatimah, and no doubt experienced extraordinary, incomprehensible things. Many people are afraid when they come to meet me. They aren’t sure if I am a man, a prophet, or a devil. They prostrate themselves. But please, Fatimah, let us speak frankly to each other.”

_An unusual man would make a place like this, then._ “Thank you for your hospitality, Raphael, and for your honesty. The _Machina_ seems like a miracle, like a cave forgotten by God. Marcelo told me that you made it. How? The things I’ve seen here are like a dream.”

“Long before it was built, the _Machina_ was revealed to me in a dream. A miraculous place. Time was dammed up and harnessed like a river. I could paint a ripe pomegranate and it would appear on the table beside me. People did not have to toil or suffer. It was like a vision of Heaven. A perfect nation.

“I woke up in the middle of the night and fervently drew schematics. I knew I needed materials that had not been discovered yet, but I had faith that what had been shown to me in the dream was real. I stayed up for seven days designing the _Machina_. Finally, when it was done, I showed my father. He was a brilliant inventor, and I sought his advice. He told me it would never work; this only increased my resolve.

“In my dream, I needed an extraordinary material that could alter the flow of time and change the nature of materials. This material has been called many things by many civilizations; the Tree of Life, the Hand of Midas, the Philosopher’s Stone. I thought it was crazy to chase a legend, but I had faith in my vision. I had little to start my search from besides ancient manuscripts and folk tales. I traveled to the edges of the world looking for the materials I needed to build the stone which powers the _Machina_, and it took me many years and perils to get them. But those are stories for another time. Suffice it to say I eventually found the stone, and with help from some of the greatest artificers that ever lived, I built the _Machina_ around the stone.

“So the _Machina_ travels across the lands like the fable of the Ark, saving people from the flood of suffering. Thousands have entered out of curiosity or fear. None have ever chosen to leave.”

“I watched from the eastern banks of the Bosporus as the _Machina_ advanced through the city,” Fatima said. “We all believed it was a devilish machine sent to punish us, or else a very clever siege weapon. You have never used the power of the stone to conquer a nation?”

Raphael looked earnestly to Fatimah. “No, I’ve never used the stone as a weapon. My schematic harnesses its energy for the good of people in all nations. I ask nothing of the people that enter the _Machina_. They are free to work or play, to stay or leave.”

“Raphael, why does no one leave if they are free to?”

“That is the only important question. Of course, I could tell you that they have food, water, shelter, and that is enough for them to stay. But these are material things. They sustain us like animals, but they do not make us who we are or fill our days with virtue.

“Fatimah, each of us is anointed with a special purpose. Something we alone can do, and must do. Most people spend their lives trying to forget that there is some unique gift they are called upon to give. People stay in the _Machina_ because it is especially easy to forget their purpose amid distraction here. And why not? Where is it written that everyone must fulfill their duty, or else be cursed to feel incomplete? Is it not a better world, a more just world if every individual is given the choice? The choice to come here and live a pleasurable life without want or worry, or the choice to stay out there, toiling to reach their potential and fulfill the purpose God has set out for them? This is why people stay in the _Machina_: out there, it hurts too much to always dream of _more_.“

“Why can’t they fulfill their purpose here?”

“To achieve anything great, Fatimah, you need to be hungry and crazy; willing to suffer for it. Perfection is not some unmistakeable trace of divine grace, and it is not some final work you complete after years of mastery. Perfection is living each day honestly with who you are. It is accepting your gifts and tolerating your weaknesses and being willing to suffer for your purpose.

“None of that is possible here. There is too much sunlight to really see the shadows.“

Fatimah felt like she had jumped into a cold pool on a hot day. Her heart was racing. She understood then that she _had_ experienced perfection. Many times. She had been searching so long for it, but it was around her already. She had experienced it in skinned knees climbing over the garden wall, in the burning-hot baklava she had stolen from her _jida’s_ kitchen, and in when she was finally satisfied with a painting after many unsuccessful attempts. She saw now that perfection was not some enduring quality about a thing. Perfection was the awareness of being alive, and being grateful for blessings and obstacles alike. _Is there a really difference between the two?_ she wondered.

It was clear now why she felt the _Machina_ fell short of perfection. _This place is full of goodness, yes. But goodness is not perfection. We can only see light in the darkness_.

“Raphael, I came into the _Machina_ thinking I would paint my final image, hopefully something I could consider perfect. But it seems that I came here for something much more valuable. To fulfill _my_ special purpose, I must leave the _Machina_.”

Raphael stopped walking and smiled to Fatimah. As if he had known how their conversation would end, they had arrived at the golden doors to the great hall and Marcelo was waiting for Fatimah. “I hoped you would say that. I’ve waited a long time for a guest with enough heart to forego the trivial pleasures of the _Machina_ and get back out there to fulfill their purpose. Good luck, Fatimah, and goodbye.”

Raphael watched as Fatimah made her way to Marcelo, smiled again, and turned back towards his seat at the end of the long table in the great hall.

\*\*\*

Marcelo guided Fatimah out through the hall, down the wide gleaming steps, through the busy _piazza_ and the market stalls there, past the large fountain of the Ark and the animals, to the large doors through which she had entered the _Machina_.

“Fatimah, you are free to leave at any time. But if I may make a request of you: tell your countrymen about this place. No one has ever left the _Machina_, so no one outside knows the goodness here. How many people have suffered outside, died of hunger or disease, because they were uncertain of the machine that approached on the horizon? Let them know about this ark.”

Fatimah nodded to Marcelo, and walked out through the great doors of the _Machina_ for the last time. To her surprise, little time had passed. The _Machina_ was closer to the eastern shore of the Bosporus where the Ottoman armies remained in formation.

The sun was only a couple hours from setting now, and the diamond bridge in front of the _Machina_ was magnificent in the summer twilight.

As she descended the stairs from the doors of the _Machina_, she felt a familiar surprise as her reveler’s clothes disappeared. When took her first step onto the bridge, she was wearing the same clothes she wore when she had set out with her uncle’s blessings to paint her grand picture, and carrying the same bag with her painting supplies. She could smell the awful briney rot of dried algae from the shore, and the sun was too hot. But she smiled, grateful for the sensation of discomfort, and continued towards the shore and towards her uncle.

\*\*\*

The army lines broke and made way for Fatimah when they recognized her. She could read the shock in their faces; the Lion, the Duke, and the Sage had failed where this girl succeeded? She continued up the embankment to where her uncle was encamped, and his janissaries parted when they recognized her. Suleiman, turning his head to see who had come to give him more bad news on this challenging day, opened his eyes wide when he saw Fatimah.

“Fatimah! You are alive. We thought like the Lion, the Duke, and the Sage, that you had perished inside the infernal machine. But God has watched over you and protected you. Tell me what you’ve seen. Show me the painting you made to memorialize the final hours of the Ottoman Empire.”

“Uncle Suleiman, I have much to tell you but I have always communicated best through colors and lines. May I paint my memorial, and then tell you what I have seen? The only thing I will say now is that these are not the final hours of the Ottomans. The ‘infernal machine’ is known as the _Machina_, and the man who built it has never used it as a weapon.”

Suleiman looked skeptically at Fatimah. “It is hard to believe someone would go through the trouble to build something as grand and arcane as that machine for any purpose besides war or worship. Our cannons and arrows are useless against it, so there is no alternative but to trust you that it is not a weapon. I have waited all day to understand this machine, and don’t mind waiting another few hours.

Fatimah took the bag off of her shoulder and pulled out her supplies. She stretched a canvas across a frame, scooped some paints onto a palette, and began.

\*\*\*

She painted a portrait of Raphael. He sat at the end of a banquet table, food and wine piled up before him, with his guests behind him.

When she was finished, she stood back from her painting and smiled. It wasn’t perfect, but it was done.

She turned her easel to face her uncle. “Tell me, Uncle Suleiman, what you see in the painting, and I will explain.”

“I see a man.”

“He is Raphael da Vinci. He built the _Machina_ after a vision he saw in a dream.”

“I see people in strange clothes behind him.”

“They are his guests. Many people live inside the _Machina_. The _Hagia Sophia_ seems much larger from the inside than the outside. It is like that in the _Machina_, only it is not a trick of the imagination. There is an entire nation carried in the belly of that machine. People of every nation are allowed into the _Machina_ without tax or burden, and they are free to leave as they wish. But, if they leave, they can never return.”

“I see an abundant banquet.”

“The _Machina_ is capable of remarkable alchemy. Food is so abundant inside that it is free. The people who live within live without disease, suffering, or want. Everything is provided for them. It is like your grand celebrations, uncle, where the entire city feasts. But it is like that every day, and the coffers within the _Machina_ are bottomless.”

“This machine sounds like a miracle, like Heaven.” Suleiman the Magnificent got up from his chair and stepped closer to the painting, and scrutinized the face of Raphael. “But his eyes are not the eyes of a man in Heaven. There is sadness in them, a burden. The light on his face is not the divine ray of Heaven, but is half-shadow. There is something missing from this vision, but I can’t put it in words.”

“In the _Machina_ it is possible to live all your life in ease and pleasure, without want or worry.But something essential is lost, and the soul is impoverished without it. The people who live in the _Machina_ are content in distraction, but they will never achieve great works.

Our greatest warrior, wealthiest merchant, and wisest sage; they are men who had achieved greatness in their lives except for the most important thing, the only thing that matters; having a heart so open, so willing to bear suffering, that it is invincible.

“So let it be said around the Empire that there is a place where everything is blessed, but nothing can be achieved. You can go there and be happy, or you can stay here, struggle, and achieve wonders that belong to you and you alone. Let it be said that every man must decide for himself whether to go or to remain.”
