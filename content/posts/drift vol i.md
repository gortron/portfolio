Good morning,

Here’s how this is going to work:

Each week, I’ll send you a dispatch from overseas at 8:00am PST, Sundays. I’m doing this so that you can stay in touch with me, and, more importantly, so that I can stay in touch with you. Simply put, you are my people. Your journey is a part of mine.

This letter is going to evolve over time. But, at a minimum, I commit to sending a brief update of where I am, where I’m going, and a question I’m mulling.

_My ask: connect me with your people (where comfortable) and let me know if you have a response to what I’m chewing on (where inspired)._

In return, I’ll send back a laughable selfie with your friends from abroad and I’ll synthesize your answers and share back any insights with the community. Sound good? Alright:

_Where I am:_ Tokyo, Japan

_Where I’m going:_ Kyoto, Japan

_What I’m chewing on:_ What is one of your specific habits of self-kindness? What do you do to treat yourself with as much love as your friends treat you?

Okay. That’s all I need, and thank you in advance for participating in another one of my social experiments. For photos and writing and beats, you can head over to DRIFT. Much love. –G

For the curious/dedicated, here’s a thin slice of my week:

- Took 846 photos and 47 minutes of video.
- Ate something that was still moving. “Slimy, yet satisfying.”
- Burned my mouth 2 times (all hail takoyaki).
- Stole at least a few hearts.
- Befriended an incredibly talented artist, Shin Iida. The scope of his work inspires me to do.
- Had beans thrown at me. Twice.
- Shared a drink with my favorite Japanese DJ.
- Got dragged out of the tuna auction by the police.
- Was confused for Tom Cruise, and did not offer a correction.
- Missed all of you a whole damn lot. xo
