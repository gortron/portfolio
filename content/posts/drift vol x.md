START There is a simple, counter-intuitive truth to saying no: it is universally more painful to say no than to hear it.

When you talked about hearing no, you talked about invention. Hearing no swings us into a Plan B mindset. It sparks our imagination. When we speak in anticipation of what a no might mean for us, we speak in dire terms. How much of a loss it will be, and how damaging to our self-esteem. It seems, though, that what we recall about hearing no was not any emotional pain of that moment but the ingenuity or reassessment induced afterwards. This, the nature of memory.

Saying no seems more challenging. It was talked about in the context of drawing boundaries, and often in places where those boundaries had failed. Saying no seems to come with the steep cost of fear in disappointing others, though we know that fear is rarely realized. We celebrate the ‘yes man,’ but is there any sense in this? No one talked about the possible joys of saying no, and freeing time for the self to celebrate a slower life. This, the nature of our need for connection.

The lesson is simple: balance your no’s and your yes’s like your yin and your yang. STOP

START "If you seek to help others - be strong in yourself - yes, even to the point of selfishness. If you seek to help others, speak truth to them - even if it hurts them (or hurts you).” STOP

START "No is just word and often a beginning." STOP

START "I try to remind myself of the reasons to say no and the reasons it's OK to say no: greatness doesn't come from pleasing everyone; I'll enjoy more if I'm more ruthless in judging what I ought to do; people don't expect me to say yes to everything (those that mind, don't matter, and those that matter don't mind)." STOP



START From The Editor

Where I am: Amritsar, India

Where I’m going: The Indian Himalayas

What I’m chewing on: What do you do slowly? What are you deliberate about giving your self the time and space to immerse yourself in? (Brewing coffee on Saturday morning, talking with your mom on the phone, drawing… let me know what comes to mind) STOP

START This is the tenth volume of drift, and I want to thank each of you for coming along with me. I’ve enjoyed curating this. The correspondence I’ve received from you, whether humorous or courageous or insightful, has moved me. It has helped me to see behind walls, to understand you and me and the thread between us. drift could not exist as it is without you. I was afraid to begin it for fear that responses would peter out. They haven’t, and my heart is ripe because of that (because of you). To celebrate the tenth volume, I’ve done two things: I’ve written a mission statement for the project (below), and created a distribution list which any of you can add to. If you think of someone who can get down with the mission, bring ‘em in (let me know if you need tech support). And, for those who wish to opt out, go ahead. No love lost. The world for you, dear reader. –G STOP

START drift is a digital publication; a weekly series of belles lettres committed to exploring the habits of good lives through regular correspondence with its community of thinkers, voyagers, and creators. STOP
