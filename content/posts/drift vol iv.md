`dispatch from 22Àö16'46", 114Àö10'57"`

Good morning bebs üåπ

## Hong Kong is a relentless and unapologizing city, whose beauty grows from its uncertain identity. My impression was first shaped by the clashing legacy of British Colonialism and endemic culture, best illustrated by subway stops which read from _Quarry Bay, Admiralty,_ and _Fortress Hill,_ to _Mong Kok, Sai Ying Pun,_ and _Wan Chai._ The subtropical humidity and vegetation, harmonizing with the six-toned Cantonese dialect, leave the city to dance a cadence which is distinctly not-Western. However there is a disproportionate Western influence from the expats living here which can be felt, for instance, in the abundance of caf√©‚Äôs serving flat whites, or restaurants advertising organic dishes. This conflict manifests, in my mind, as a tremendous vibrance; a garish, sooty, thronging, and ultimately charismatic vibrance. It is at least as easy to love Hong Kong as it is to hate it. The choice, as always, is yours.

**Where I am:** Hong Kong

**Where I am going:** Singapore

## **What I‚Äôm chewing on:** What brings out the best in you? What are your secret tactics for bringing out the best in others?

## On Imperfection

I apologize for last week‚Äôs prompt. I asked you about your imperfections, and whether you try to sand their edges, or embrace them as they are. As one of you pointed out in your response (quoted below), to denote one of your qualities as imperfect is to implicitly say that there is such a thing as aperfect quality. If you or I have a perfect quality, dear reader, I would love to hear what it might be.

The questions I was trying to get at, though, are what is flawed about you? What do you find difficult to love in your personality? How do you cope with that part of your self? Thank you to those of you who wrote in: it takes courage to talk about weakness. From your responses, there are three lessons.

The first thing I noticed is that each of you opened up about your flaws in the same breath that you detailed your strengths, almost without exception. You would talk about how your confidence can lend you a commanding presence or an intimidating one, or about how your short memory allows you to forgive and unfortunately to forget. So, the first lesson is this: **Our greatest strength and our greatest weakness are two sides of the same coin. It‚Äôs the same characteristic, manifesting in different contexts.**

The second observation is that our flaws do not exist in a vacuum. Most readers articulated their weaknesses by describing generalized interactions with others. We are as much what we are as what we are not, which is to say that part of our understanding of who we are is only revealed to us through our interactions and our understanding of others. Strength and weakness are not absolutes: they exist relatively. Not only do our loved ones help us understand our weakness, they also help us compensate for them. We know from our own experience that we have provided small acts of service behind our friends‚Äô backs. So, whether we choose to fix or embrace our flaws, we can‚Äôt move alone; we are completed by others. The second lesson is this: **When we are courageous and vulnerable about what makes us feel weak, the universe moves to balance us and make us more whole.**

There is a wonderful, tragic irony in our flaws. What we believe is unlovable about us is what others perceive as lovable about us. The people who stick, the ones that matter (you, reader), love us as much for our flaws as for our gifts. Each of us knows how to taunt with our strengths, but our weaknesses are precisely elements of our personality which we are awkward and unwieldy with. Our flaws are the most authentic pieces of us. They are our deepest channels for empathy and connection, and it‚Äôs a sad trick that we feel so compelled to conceal them. There‚Äôs a beautiful quote from an _imam_ which goes, ‚Äúhumility is the shortest distance between two people.‚Äù The third lesson, then: **Replace your posturing with humility. If you hide behind your strengths, no one will find you.**

From the constituents:

- ‚ÄúI actually find this question troubling. Because it implies that it is possible to have perfect qualities at all. I do not think there is a single quality about me that is perfect. There are many things that I love about myself and would never change, but I do not think humans exist for perfection.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIn business I have always said that our job is to ‚Äòaccentuate strength and compensate for weakness‚Äô of those around us. Know what they are good at, cultivate and make use of that strength and try to work around the bad stuff. It‚Äôs like that in life and in relationships, too. Appreciate your friends for their good traits and forgive them for their bad traits.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúImperfection is found in excess. Perfection is a state of balance.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI think there is an overarching theme here. I think humans are created imperfect so that we can rely on others to help us grow as individuals. I think humans require a sense of community so that we can learn about our imperfections from others.‚Äù

## The Thin Slice:

- Ate okonomiyaki five times in three days (crepe, cabbage, bean sprouts, bacon, egg, dried fish, and ‚Äúsauce‚Äù).
- Found myself conflicted when the young women running the Hiroshima hostel, without prompt, began calling me daddy.
- Went behind the bar and tended at said hostel because, honestly, if you‚Äôve reached a point where people are calling you daddy you can get away with anything.
- Started a dance party in the street at 4am.
- Was left raw from learning about the bombing of Hiroshima at the end of WWII from the perspective of the vanquished.
- Learned that Madagascar was settled by Indonesians, and not sub-Saharan Africans. How crazy is that!? Indonesia is 4,000 miles further away from Madagascar than modern-day Mozambique! How about that!
- Practiced the _gudetama_ dance with an octogenarian.
  Had a big first: a day where I did not see another white person.
- Connected with someone from one of your introductions. - Alchemy turned drinks into dinner and back into drinks. Thank you to those of you who have connected me with your people so far‚Äîthese have been fantastic moments on my journey.
- Coordinated meeting up with several of you on the road! If you‚Äôre interested in drifting with me, let me know; I‚Äôm certainly interested in drifting with _you_. ‚ÄìG
