## On Foreign Expressions

I hold an untestable hypothesis that if one could learn every phrase of every language, then one could feel the full extent of the human experience more richly. Language is meaning. Our empathy is spurred almost entirely by another’s words. While there are of course expressions outside of language (Turrell, jazz, etc.), for most of us for most of the time our words are the primary vehicle for connection. I don’t believe that a sophisticated vocabulary is superior to a simplistic one. But, the line between precise language and lazy language is thin, blurred. I am an advocate for mastering as much of your native language as you can, and stealing from the languages of other cultures to compensate for its limitations.

Reading through your response to last week’s prompt on foreign expressions was like peaking into the cabinet of your kitchen. Eating the cuisine of another culture reveals an important practice of its people; speaking the language reveals a better understanding of their experiences. The diversity of cultures extends beyond nations, and it is the spice of life. The language we use to share our experiences changes within whichever community we are participating in, and impacts what we are experiencing in itself. Learning an expression which articulates a nuanced feeling provides us with a scaffold for that experience, so that we are better equipped to handle and share that experience when next we encounter it. Here are some of my favorites:

**Illunga** (Tshiluba, Democratic Republic of Congo): a person who is ready to forgive any abuse for the first time, to tolerate it a second time, but never a third time.

**Dépaysement** (French): the feeling that comes from not being in one’s home country; disorientation due to experience of unfamiliar surroundings, a sense in which one is “a fish out of water"

**Yamche** (South Korean): “hey-you-sneaky-person-I’m-calling-you-out. My mother would call me _yamche_ if I snuck bits of dinner during cooking instead of waiting for everyone to eat together… It’s kind of loving, at least in my family. And usually the one being _yamche_ knows they’re doing it too. Comes with a sheepish smile.”

**Gigil** (Tagalog, Philippines): something or someone that is so cute that you feel compelled to squeeze it.

**Gönnen** (German): “The opposite of to be jealous or to feel _schadenfreude_, meaning one is happy for someone else’s fortune.“

**Hail Mary** (American): "I’m thinking about this question backwards. Instead of foreign expressions not translating to English; what about English expressions not translating to foreign languages? And to refine the subject further, what about expressions in the ‘American’ language?… 'It’s a Hail Mary'—to do something with very little chance of success.”

## The Thin Slice

- Traveled 203 miles by bus through the Sri Lankan countryside, representative of a significant portion of the country.
- Was invited to sit on the dashboard next to the driver for the portion of those miles that passed through the tea plantations of the highlands.
- Recognized the phrase Don’t Worry, it’s Sri Lanka as a verbal panacea for the country’s many gaps in infrastructure.
- Survived a hornet swarm on top of the sky fortress of Siguriya.
- Napped in a hut with workers through the mid-day heat by Sigiriya.
- Swam in my skivvies in Lake Polonnaruwa with the local boys.
- Learned the head bobble, a ubiquitous gesture of trust and good will in the subcontinent.
- Accepted an offered beer at a roadside kitchen and watched as the family fussed and threw their eldest daughter into a tuktuk to town to, apparently, buy the individual beer. - You can’t make this shit up.
