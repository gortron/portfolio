I was raised in the kitchen, and since then I've spent my years trying to connect with people, develop first principles, and build cool stuff.

I'm keen on cooking, _bon mots_, backcountry camping, sci-fi, meditation, Hanabi, and journaling. Not so keen on big egos, absolutism, and show-offs.

## Some of my beliefs:

1. kindness is the greatest good.
2. done is better than perfect.
3. authenticity, always.
4. everyone knows something I don‚Äôt.
5. seek powerful moments.
6. question everything.
7. humility is the shortest distance between us.
8. the obstacle is the way.
9. live in service to my community.
10. listen before speaking.

These drives have taken me around the world, helped me write some things, motivated me to study engineering and build biomedical tools and websites, and given me a few fun rides with a couple startup/scaleup companies as an operator.

I believe that the internet has connected us in discrete but powerful ways. If you're here, reading this, then it's likely that we share a culture and a way of being in the world. I'm here with you‚Äîdon't be a stranger.
