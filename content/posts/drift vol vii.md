## So Long, Bali

I stood still for a day. I shaved, rested. While I slept in the shade, it trapped me. Canggu a tropical flower, a saturated beauty. I came close, licked the honey and stumbled into the acid. It digested and robbed the bits of me it could, leaving a turd of another Southeast-Asia-traveling 20-something. The damned (masquerading as travelers) loitering in purgatory (masquerading as air-conditioned cafés). Hell is repeating a tired conversation with boring people. _Where are you from? When did you get here? Where are you going next? The beer is cheap!_ I meant to leave on the third day. Drive north, over the mountains and back into the sea. That morning I woke up hungover. I spent another five days in Canggu. _One more day_ is a mantra here. A joke among the jailed, the prisoners of paradise.

“Travelers" cram themselves into a short strip of pleasant coastline chasing a dream that died ten years before they got here, and drinking their way into the end of days. The fact reveals itself: I. I am not a voyager. No, here I am a voyeur. We all are. We’re poisoning the well. I don’t know what neocolonialism is, but I bet it looks like _warungs_ selling kombucha to backpackers with mandala tattoos. We crashed our metaphorical cruise ship into a coral reef, swam to shore, and rebuilt only the convenient and affirmative parts of civilization. _I’m no better_. I love the cheap massages and the organic breakfasts and the awful Bob Marley covers; I hate that I don’t want to leave. This town is rotting and I can’t get enough of the smell.

At least the sunsets are nice.

## An Apology

The responses to last week’s prompt on surrender were sparse, meaningful. I’ve responded to each of you individually. I lit a torch where I shouldn’t have. We can’t know what things are too near to touch until we’ve already touched them. This topic was demonstrably beyond the intimacy of our correspondence. I’m sorry that I don’t have any truth or interesting half-truths to offer you, now. Don’t worry, friends—the wheel keeps turning.

## From the Editor

**Where I am:** (in transit to) Colombo, Sri Lanka

**Where I’m going:** Through the Sri Lankan highlands.

**What I’m chewing on:** I’ve got a thing for nuanced expressions in foreign languages which don’t translate well to English. Shanti shanti, wabi sabi, duende. Throw me one; what does it mean, and what does it mean to you? Bonus points awarded to those who have one from their own cultural heritage.

Let’s try this again next week. Peace and love. –G

## The Thin Slice

- Caught the sunset wave. Utah, get me two!
- Chaffed my nipples beyond recognition. Listed: KIA.
- Developed a bond with my scooter. We took two road trips into the mountains, through rain and over fields. It was a good autobike, and I wish it well in all its future endeavors. I’m sorry for crashing you into a wall.
- Saw an old woman naked above the waste kindling a rubbish fire, tatas sweeping the asphalt. National Geographic, eat your heart out.
- Sang loudly in the road and the late night, a drunken chorus backing a ukulele. Let’s Get It On is a fair response to last-call.
- Became many shades darker. Ass like the Coppertone Girl.
- Did open air yoga in 90˚ and 66%. Bikram papi.
- Witnessed a 40-something on her Eat, Pray, Love journey jump up on a table and go full Coyote Ugly. God bless you, you beautiful disaster.
