Good morning _mes semblables_,

I want to open today’s drift with an invocation, an exploration on the Japanese concept of _wabi sabi_. _Wabi sabi_ is one of those fantastic, exotic expressions which bares no easy translation. It is simultaneously a philosophy, cultural ideal, and aesthetic. It has a lot to do with surrendering to the transience of life, and celebrating the imperfections which grow from that garden bed. For you and I, for we raised in the west, this is a horse pill to swallow: we were taught differently. Going back to Plato and the _Allegory of the Cave_, there has been an understanding in the west that perfection exists, albeit out of our reach. That there is also a cultural attitude that perfection is something we should measure our selves and our efforts against is an unanswerable paradox.

This morning, I encourage you to question your commitment to pursuing perfection or embracing imperfection. I, for one, find the celebration of imperfection compelling. It’s difficult for me to relate to something which is perfect; something which is timeless. How could I appreciate such a thing? The best I can do is admire it. But, imperfection is yummy. I can relate to imperfection. To me, a thing that is flawed and mortal opens into an entire field of grief and sorrow which I can feel for it, which makes it the more beautiful. In my eyes, beauty is about the range and depth of what you can feel for a thing. So: to transience, imperfection, and _wabi sabi_.

Thank you to those of you who wrote in, articulating what greatness means to you. I’m humbled to be on the receiving end of such constructive, insightful commentary. You are the apples of my eye.

There were two camps in your responses on greatness:

1. **GREATNESS IS PRESENCE:** Most of you hold that greatness is measured as a quality of one’s character. Greatness in this camp is described as bold, confident, and courageous. The ‘greats’ carry no regrets, having given themselves completely towards their goal, great or small. Greatness is something that exists for someone in the present. Greatness, for this camp of thinkers, is democratic and attainable for all.
2. **GREATNESS THROUGH ACTION:** Others contend that greatness is the sum of one’s bold, successful actions. To this camp, the ‘greats’ are innovators and leaders. Greatness is something that exists for someone because of the past. Greatness, for this camp, is something that is reserved for eminence.

It’s no mistake that both of these themes of responses arose. You and I intuit that greatness exists in different scopes. There are names which echo through time because they reshaped civilization, and there are people in our community who are loved and respected. We know that each is great, in their own right.

Perhaps then, the community’s definition of greatness can be phrased like this: _greatness is a confident presence which one earns through a lifetime by committing oneself to act boldly, give an absolute effort, and thereby achieve their goals (grand or humble) and respect from others._

Some delicious quotable nuggets from you:

- “For me that means the ability to take risk, bet on the slim margin, to be fearless in your belief and your course, to be bold.”
- "Simply put, after my time on Earth is up I want people to say that I was a great human… How they should strive to be like me when they grow up.”
- "Greatness is a distant light on the horizon that I am always in pursuit of. Living my life striving to achieve greatness is in itself a ‘great’ pursuit. If I feel as though I am performing at my highest octane then I will have achieved greatness for myself.”
- I keep coming back to that Shakespeare quote, "Some are born great, others achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."
- “Greatness is doing the hard thing—the right thing—again, and again, and again.”

**Where I am:** Hiroshima, Japan

**Where I’m going:** Hong Kong, China

**What I’m chewing on:** What is a specific habit or character quality you have that you feel is imperfect? Do you try to fix it, or do you embrace it?

Until next week’s dispatch, dear reader. I think you’re pretty great. –G

The Thin Slice:

- Finished a Russian novel.
- Hit my head a dozen times on low entryways. There’s an apparently inverse relation between accommodation for foreigners and distance from Tokyo.
- Was invited to a home-cooked & hand-cut sushi dinner.
- Ate pizza (“Napori Sarami") and a hamburger. Don’t judge me.
- Lost my camera on the bus.
- Retrieved my lost camera from the bus station lost and found, because Japan is the most civilized country on Earth.
- Spent Saturday night trying to explain Sophia Coppola’s Lost in Translation to a bartender whose English was, predictably, a 2/10.
- Walked 14.2 miles in a single day (it was today. à bientôt, lovelies.)
