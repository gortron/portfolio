## On Powerful Moments

The pursuit of happiness, and implicitly its capture, was promised to us as an inalienable right in 1776. The assumption is that we are all happy; the reality is that few of us are; the truth is that is OK. Insisting that each of us finds happiness and lives their bliss, though noble, sets us up for failure. There is no greater danger to our emotional well-being than to instill an unfaltering belief that happiness is the end goal of The Good Life. If a constant low-voltage contentment is expected as a norm, then we will inevitably feel disappointment. How can a cult of happiness account for challenge, the ebb and flow of success and failure? Life unfolds differently than we expected it to, with greater growing pains than we hoped it would have.

To fetishize half of the human emotional range leaves us ill-equipped to live with the other half, and more dangerously, shames us into being silent about difficult experience. The prompt last week was a red herring. No burden is borne alone, though many feel theirs is. The burdens mentioned by you, dear reader, were universal. Trouble with a failing business, disappointing loved ones, navigating the difficult waters of family: each anecdote a unique expression of a common experience. The feeling of isolation is the work of our cultural bias against struggle and against authenticity. The disconnection emerges from the institutional habit to hide an important part of our experience (that which makes us seem weak). This can’t be condemned. Who has not felt this? Maybe we can make something better, though. We should praise genius and talent, but not at the cost of recognizing tenacity and perseverance.

Then, a simple edit for Jefferson: life, liberty, and the pursuit of powerful moments. The greatest good is to feel as deeply and broadly as one is capable of. Happiness, triumph, and joy are only one side of the spectrum which spans to sorrow, failure, and anger. The emotions that produce pleasure and those which produce pain are drawn from the same well. The extent to which you can feel one is the same as which you can feel the other. You can’t live a life which is only happy, and I wouldn’t want you to if you could. I want you to be resilient, ready when the lights go out.

These are the physics of human feeling, and this is a case for passion. Powerful moments are those which move us. They hold fast to our memory, and reorient us to the world. Graphing feeling over time, powerful moments look like an 8.8 on the Richter. When you feel profound achievement, and are afraid of how far you still have to go: powerful moment. Happiness for a friend who has outgrown you: powerful moment. Last night with a lover: powerful moment. It is a philosophy of leaning in to challenging and simultaneously conflicting feelings. It is a commitment to seek growth, not comfort—the camp bed and the cloak.

## From The Editor

**Where I am:** (en route to) Varanasi, India

**Where I’m going:** Amritsar, India

**What I’m chewing on:** Talk to me about saying no. Where have you drawn boundaries, and when have you failed to do so?

There is in the Indian subcontinent and in its sister Sri Lanka a compulsive reluctance to say no. In response to an inquiry as clear-cut as where can I find the bus station, people here are more comfortable offering information which is discretely untrue than they are in refusing their assistance. It is, as far as cultural habits go, inoffensive and frustrating. The heart of the act is good and affirms the best within us. The irony is that it’s near impossible to get the help you’re asking after. The consequence is an old lesson: that you will always find what you’re looking for, but the cost will be greater than you had hoped to pay and it will look different than you had expected.

I want to know about the no. Drop me a line. Stay smooth. –G

## The Thin Slice

- Summited Sri Pada at 4:30am. The mile climb in elevation is challenging, but made easier by the presence of thousand year old Sri Lankan raisin-women.
- Pulled leeches off my skin, shouting.
- Ate a jar of peanut butter in two days. Sri Lankan food in a word: bleak. (Edit 07/26/2020: I was mistaken, then. Sri Lankan food is incredible. I often crave coconut curry and hoppers, or _kottu roti_. Those flavours have stuck with me through the years.)
- Took a train through miles of mountainous tea plantations.
- Arrived in Colombo with \$.30 in hand, greasy from a six hour bus stretch. Negotiated a trip to the airport using an illegal currency. The driver, assessing my character, asked me to watch his bike for five minutes and returned with an impressive joint (politely declined).
- After the tuktuk ride with the Spirit of Jah himself, at the airport, it was brought to my attention that the Indian eVisa does not process instantaneously. I have never claimed to be a clever man.
- Scolded for kissing in public in a buddhist country.
- Strolled through the botanical gardens of Kandy. Nearly shat on by a bat.
- Saw more lightning in the last week than I have in all the years preceding.
- Woke up in a cloud.
