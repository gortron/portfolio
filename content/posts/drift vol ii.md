Good morning and hello my lovelies,

I am deeply moved by the response, in both volume and quality, to last week’s theme on habits of self-love. I’m humbled by both your vulnerability and your generosity of spirit.

I’m not sure where we are, you and I. When I started this weekly dispatch, what I’m calling drift, my vision had two elements:

1. challenge myself, creatively, to communicate an experience which is unique to me

2. remain in touch with the people who matter to me—the stars in my sky while at sea

I now think, though, that there’s an alluring possibility of a third element:

3. draw from this community’s well of wisdom and do some whiteboarding on the Big Questions

Let's give it a shot.

Here were the motifs I observed in your responses to how you treat yourself with love:

1. **WELLNESS:** Many of you oriented around loving your body. Your answers reflected what is often intuited but occasionally practiced: that the foundation of wellness is a commitment to sleeping, eating well, and exercising. One of you offered the phrase, “thank you, good little body,” as a trigger to remind yourself that your body is the only thing that accompanies you from start to finish on your journey. It was there before consciousness, and will remain when consciousness fails. Love it for it’s commitment to you, if for nothing else.

2. **EGO:** From your responses, it seems that self-love for some is rooted in understanding that intrepid, insidious voice in our heads, and loving that voice. This voice can be, frankly, a shitty roommate in your mind. It evolved to identify risk and flag it for your consciousness, but it seems to spend more time knocking things off your mental shelves than saving you from eating poison. Three common habits were mentioned, in coming to terms with your ego: journaling to give the ego a container to speak coherently, having a morning routine so that you can ease the ego into the day with a few certainties, and scheduling alone time so that you and your ego can go play together.

3. **THE OBVIOUS ANSWER:** There was one common response that carried itself with the elegant simplicity characteristic of a good Truth. Many of you explicitly say I love you, to yourself. Some say it out loud, in a mirror even, while others echo it internally. I encourage you each to give this habit a space, and see if it sticks: I’ve been working with it all week, and personally vouch for it’s efficacy.

And, here were some quotable nuggets from you, my correspondentia:

- “Our ego is an illusion of consciousness.“
- “I’ve been giving myself a short hug, wrapping my arms around my chest anytime I’m feeling ashamed, embarrassed, or hurt and I imagine hugging that little kid inside me. Feel it, hug it, release it.”
- “Take it easy and work as hard as possible—somehow, not a mutually exclusive pair. Beyoncé wasn’t built in a day.”

We can be confident this isn’t the final word on self-love, dear reader. It’s a start, though, and it belongs to us.

I can’t know what drift will become, but I suspect that it (like you and I) is destined to become more of what it already is.

**Where I am:** Kyoto, Japan

**Where I’m going:** Onomichi, Japan

**What I’m chewing on:** How do you define greatness for yourself? What is one specific vision you hold for what it looks like for you to be great?

I want to hear what you think, sojourner. Write me something. And, if you can’t commit to that, then commit to a selfie for me. They’re like digital high fives.

Love ya. Miss ya. Mean it. –G

You liked the thin slice of last week, did you? Very well. Here’s another:

- Took 103,593 steps.
- Lost a few days in a blizzard in a rural Japanese town in the mountains.
- Was adopted by a Japanese great-grandmother. She could not speak English, nor I Japanese, but LOVE EXISTS BEYOND LANGUAGE.
- Slept in four different beds.
- Survived an earthquake.
- Survived what is euphemistically known as The Great Kyoto hangover.
- Was a victim in an instance of racial segregation.
- Overcame that instance of racial segregation. I stand on the shoulders of giants, in this regard.
- Took a few tranny pics with some Aussies in a photobooth (available upon request).
- Had a religious moment and withstood dead-sober hallucination.
- Ate kelp. Listen, friends: the future isn’t as bad as it may seem.
